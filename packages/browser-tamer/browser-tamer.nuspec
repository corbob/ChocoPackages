## Note regarding VirusTotal detections

The software vendor is [aware](https://github.com/aloneguid/bt/issues/27) that a number of AV vendors detect it as potentially unwanted and may block it.

  - [URL un-shortening](https://aloneguid.github.io/bt/url-pipeline.html#un-shortening).

## Statistics

In 2023, Browser Tamer was installed by **5150 people** and in December 2023 it had **561 regular users** (using BT constantly for more than 7 days in a row)! This is all I can expose, as only very basic anonymous stats are reported (the fact that you have launched BT).

## Contributing

I value your interest in this open-source project. While **I don't accept pull requests** (there is no way to turn them off in GitHub), your support through coffee donations directly contributes to the project's development and sustainability, allowing me to invest more resources into refining, addressing issues, and implementing new features. Your involvement, in any form, is greatly appreciated. Thank you for being a part of our journey!
